## What is an Android Custom ROM :
Android ROM is to a phone’s firmware, based on Google’s Android platform. Android is open source and that’s why any developer can edit the source code, recompile it, and re-release for a wide variety of devices. Users can install ROMs to change a device’s look and behaviour. All Custom ROMs are developed by the Android community, mostly a group of core developers who do this purely out of a passion for modding. This means that most are absolutely free. Custom ROMs are available for Android phones, tablets, media players, smartwatches and almost any type of device which is running Android.

When you buy your Android phone, it comes with a “stock ROM” or the “stock firmware”. This is to the preinstalled version of the operating system. This ROM has limited functionality as defined by the phone’s manufacturer. By flashing a custom ROM, you can unlock extra functionality and sometimes improve the performance.
